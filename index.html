    <h2>About me</h2>
      <p>I have been attending Mount Hood Community College pursuing my AAS in Computer Information Systems. I currently work as a sales associate at Fred Meyer to establish a work history. I joined Epicodus so I could learn programming exclusively and in a focused environment. The ideas behind pair programming is great, as it helps me learn faster with a partner. I hope to learn more as time goes on, and possibly attend the full time class if I do well in the intro class.</p>
